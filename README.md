# notifications
Lightweight framework for sending notifications from python.

## Background
This is a product of several projects which involved long running programs which I wanted to update me in the event of specific events or errors or to simply send a synopsis of operation at a certain time interval. I have condensed the solutions from those projects into a framework which makes it easy to send notifications through a variety of channels and generate them from a variety of events.
